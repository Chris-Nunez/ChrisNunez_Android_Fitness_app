This fitness tracker mobile app was created using Android Studio Kotlin as a class assignment.
The back end API that handles the data was provided by the professor and this code focuses on accessing those API endpoints from the front end.

This app includes 
 - A Login page
 - A Registration page
 - A Main Menu page that includes a calorie tracker
 - A Page to log exercise activities and exercise duration
 - A History page to view all the exercises a user has entered as well as the calories burned.

The video below walks through all the pages and functionalities of the fitness tracker mobile app.
